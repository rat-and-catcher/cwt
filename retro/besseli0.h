/*************************************************************************
Modified Bessel function of order zero

Returns modified Bessel function of order zero of the
argument.

The function is defined as i0(x) = j0( ix ).

The range is partitioned into the two intervals [0,8] and
(8, infinity).  Chebyshev polynomial expansions are employed
in each interval.

ACCURACY:

                     Relative error:
