# cwt -- Complex (audio) Wave Tool

In ./retro folder you can to find old sources of our *old* cwave prodution tool (cw).
This is Windows only CLI program; and have lots of limitations (input -- 16 bit stereo
WAV w/o any metadata and chunks different from 'fmt ' and 'data'; ASCII charset for
file names and so). Its need FFTW3 (fftw3.org) library to compile and work.

##..we do hope to provide better tool in the repo..
